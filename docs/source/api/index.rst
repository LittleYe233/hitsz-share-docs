API Reference
=============

This is the API reference of the whole project, including function definitions, parameter notes and so on.

.. note::

   Most of the project is written in JavaScript, and declarations of many functions are placed in ``.d.ts`` files, not enclosed in the ``.js`` script files like JSDoc. So please remember that there are many definitions of ``type``\s that may be confusing and not clear when you use an IDE to check the types of some identifiers. Certainly, details of all the ``type``\s are shown in this reference. And if you have just followed a link from the ``.js`` code - congratulations! You find the right place!
